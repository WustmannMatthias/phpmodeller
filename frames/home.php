		First, make sure you have the repository of your project cloned in the

		Then, from the New Project tab, fill the name of your project, and the settings you want to use. Multiple values within a field have to be separated by commas.<br>
		Once you'll have validated, a first iteration including the whole project will be created.

		First of all, you need to put the repository of your project at his new iteration in the /data/projects directory of PHP-Modeller. Take care to pull the repository from Github, and not to replace it by a new clone, otherwise to last modification date of each file will be erased.
